BabylonPress 3D Wordpress Plugin allows you to publish the examples from Babylon.js PlayGround at your Wordpress website.

It has a lot of useful options and gives more freedom to developers and 3D artists, who are now able to easily publish their 3D content at Wordpress-driven site.

Basically the process is as simple as copying/pasting the code from a Babylon.js PlayGround, and choose several options. You can not only use the PlayGround but also any environment to produce necessary .js code.

BabylonPress 3D Wordpress plugin is in an active development stage; the first alpha release is planned at January 2021 and will be published at GitHub as an open source project.
